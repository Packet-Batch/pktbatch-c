// WARNING: Experimental
// When defined, the AF_XDP socket's UMEM frame buffers doesn't get the packet
// buffer copied to it after the first time. This should technically result in
// better throughput due to reduced memory copying, but only would work for
// completely static packets. #define AF_XDP_NO_REFILL_FRAMES

// If defined, the program will attempt to raise the stack limit. This shouldn't
// be needed, but wanted to include just in case. #define CONF_UNLOCK_RLIMIT

// If defined, the program uses a much more randomized seed by retrieving random
// bytes from `/dev/urandom`. This results in more randomness with each packet,
// but adds a bit more overhead. #define VERY_RANDOM

// If defined, if we only detect a single static packet being sent, we skip a
// lot of unnecessary steps.
#define SEQUENCE_USE_STATIC_PKT

// If defined, attempts to generate the most amount of packets per second by
// sending single empty packets (of any of the protocols) with static packets.
// All checks are also skipped including limits such as time, max packets,
// packet rates, etc. This is to achieve max throughput possible. #define
